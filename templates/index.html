  animated using computer graphics and falls into the Machinima subgenre. It has
  filled the imaginations of many childeren and created a huge fanbase. It
  originally came from the internet viral video uploaded by DafuqBoom that
  sparked an uprise in brainrot and created the new generation of degeneracy.
  The Skibidi Toilets are a race of sentient toilets with human heads, whose
  only form of communication is a nonsensical song they sing over and over. The
  ``good'' guys in the series are humans dressed in business suits with various
  appliances such as cameras or speakers for heads.
